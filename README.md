This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving improper handling of null or undefined values and a type mismatch when using methods like 'length' on non-array/string objects.  The 'bug.js' file contains the flawed code, while 'bugSolution.js' provides a corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of robust input validation and error handling in JavaScript to prevent unexpected behavior and crashes.
